**1DCircular_Mrhogreaterthan1.ipynb**: 
Script for running 1-D circular stepping-stone population simulations where 1 << m*rho << L over 50 trials and outputs the allele frequency spectrum seen in Fig 6.

**1DCircular_Mrhogreaterthan1.ipynb**: 
Script for running 1-D circular stepping-stone population simulations where m*rho << 1 << L over 50 trials and outputs the allele frequency spectrum seen in Fig 5 along with the Voter Model + Wright Fisher fits

**1D_Stepping_Stone.pdf**:
Graphic for 1-D circular stepping-stone population 

**2D_Toroidal_Simulation.ipynb**:
Script for running 2-D toroidal stepping-stone population simulations where m*rho << 1  over 50 trials and outputs the allele frequency spectrum seen in Fig 12 along with the Wright Fisher fit. Simply change m*rho value to make it >> 1 to get Fig 11. 

**Heterozygosity_Mrhogreat.ipynb**: 
Script for calculating the mean heterozygosity for 1-D circular stepping-stone populations when 1 << m*rho << L. Outputs heteerozygosity plot seen in Fig 10. 

**Heterozygosity_Mrholess.ipynb**: 
Script for calculating the mean heterozygosity for 1-D circular stepping-stone populations when m*rho << 1 << L . Outputs heteerozygosity plot seen in Fig 9. 

**Spatial_Plots_Mrhogreat.ipynb**: 
Script for running the spatial plot for 1-D circular stepping-stone populations when 1 << m*rho << L. Outputs multiple spatial plots within the transition zone like the plot seen in Fig 4.

**Spatial_Plots_Mrholess.ipynb**: 
Script for running the spatial plot for 1-D circular stepping-stone populations when m*rho << 1 << L. Outputs multiple spatial plots within the transition zone like the plot seen in Fig 3.Spatial_cartoon_fixation.pdf

**Spatial_cartoon_prefixation.pdf and Spatial_cartoon_fixation.pdf**: 
Cartoon representations for spatial plots above seen in Fig 7 and 8.
